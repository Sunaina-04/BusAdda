            <h2>Sunaina Sharma</h2>
            <p><strong>Role on Website:</strong> <span class="highlight-text">Project Manager </span></p>
            <p><strong>Aim:</strong> This project aims to create a website that provides real-time college bus arrival and departure information for students and staff, empowering them with convenient commute planning and reducing uncertainty. Beyond user convenience, the system will offer the college administration valuable data insights into route efficiency, passenger loads, and potential bottlenecks, facilitating optimized scheduling, route adjustments, and efficient resource allocation, ultimately lowering operational costs and improving service coverage. A significant aspect is the transition of security personnel from manual pen-and-paper data entry to a more efficient digital system for recording bus movements. </p>
            <p><strong>Contributions:</strong>We started the project with the goal of moving security guards from a pen-and-paper, manual data entry system to a more effective digital platform for tracking bus movements.  Each team member's roles and responsibilities were clearly laid out in detail, which resulted in the creation of a central repository called "Bus Adda."  I oversaw branch operations and settled merge disputes during the development process to guarantee smooth integration. I added "About Us" page and offered code support as needed. Git Actions and Pages were used in the platform's deployment, allowing for automatic updates in response to file changes.
                The project's simplicity and early completion allowed for an early expansion of its scope to incorporate elements that would benefit both staff and students.</p>
