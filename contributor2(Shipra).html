            <h2>Shipra</h2>
            <p><strong>Role on Website:</strong> <span class="highlight-text">Front-end Developer</span></p>
            <p><strong>Aim:</strong> This project aims to create a website that provides real-time college bus arrival and departure information for students and staff, empowering them with convenient commute planning and reducing uncertainty. Beyond user convenience, the system will offer the college administration valuable data insights into route efficiency, passenger loads, and potential bottlenecks, facilitating optimized scheduling, route adjustments, and efficient resource allocation, ultimately lowering operational costs and improving service coverage. A significant aspect is the transition of security personnel from manual pen-and-paper data entry to a more efficient digital system for recording bus movements. </p>
            <p><strong>Contributions:</strong> The initial goal of the project was to transition security guards from a manual, pen-and-paper system to a more efficient digital platform for tracking bus movements. Each team member had clearly defined roles and responsibilities, leading to the creation of a centralized platform called "Bus Adda." I played a key role in overseeing branch operations and resolving merge conflicts to ensure smooth development integration. My contributions included implementing login and sign-up pages for both the student and guard dashboards, adding a profile section for students, and incorporating a contact us feature to improve user interaction.Additionally, I created an API to receive emails from various sections, including the Contact Us and Feedback forms, using an API key for efficient communication.</p>
